		<text>You, young man, Stalker or whatever you call yourself! You seem not as simple minded as the others. Maybe you see the value in our work, yes?! Science demands much, when not all. Please would you be so kind to provide for our studies? We cannot risk to run out of samples to catalogue. Please get me what you can! The scientific community will thank you and I will handsomely pay you for your support. Yes?</text>

    <string id="igi_task_text_arszi_fetch_trophy_about">
		<text>Meat is not the only part of mutants, which might be valuable. Some stalkers prize specific parts of mutants as trophies or lucky charms. You know, like a nice pseudodog fang necklace or a fluffy cat tail hanging from the belt. Anyone can hunt down a mutant and wear its parts as a symbol of achivement, but to create exceptionally spectacular items, it requires real skill! - Bring me some trophies, and I'll craft some stylish accessories out of them. Are you in?</text>

		<text>Some fine materials you've gathered. Well done, hunter.</text>
